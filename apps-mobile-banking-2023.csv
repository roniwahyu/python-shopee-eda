Occasionally manual adjustments works, but more often than not it doesn\'t work at all. The app /still/ doesn\'t show cents, despite seemingly using them behind-the-scene, leading to a very small difference between the balance shown on the app vs. what you would have if you calculated your transaction manually, as you can only see up to ones and not cents. Every other banking app I used shows cents values, because they value transparency and accuracy.', ""This app is the real digital bank. It is easy to use, has a nice design, and it is really helpful for the millenials with its sharing feature. I'm giving four stars because there is still a room for improvement in the pocket feature. Unlike normal transfer where we can give description, unfortunately, this is not the case when we move our money from saving pockets to main pocket. It only has category options. It would be great if description is also added when we choose the category."", 'There are several pain points in this application that seem to be no way to turn them off. For example: 1. Every time I opened the app, Jago always wanted to get my feedback, whether it got the categorization right for my recent transactions, I thought this is one or two times thing that Jago will eventually stop asking for my feedback once It learned after I manually categorizing the transaction. 2. The constant pop up telling me the session has ended.', 'The idea of being able to manage pockets is awesome! One issue I\'ve been experiencing lately is the app constantly shows a toast saying ""Something went wrong. Let\'s try again"". Aside of that, everything work great!', ""Please fix the app. It's sooo lagging to move the money, transfer, basically for doing any operation, even when the connection is fine. If there is bank digital that offer pocket feature, I will move on from Jago to be honest. The only thing make me stay is the pocket feature since I have numerous saving/spending sections."", 'Ngelag parah. The app lagging, lagging, and lagging. Phone already have 8GB RAM and only run Jago, but keep lagging, especially when you are about paying with QR in quick.', ""Phone on root with magisk, Jago is in deny list to keep it safe. But i still can't open it. Hope this will be fixed because I need root to keep my phone working"", 'The apps is great. 1 apps for all needs. I satisfy to use this bank apps, so many benefit and free adm transfer/top up ewallet and also already has BI Fast service. I also can separate many kinds of ""kantong"" following our needs the important thing is Jago has QRIS. Thanks Jago. Maju terus!', 'Had some questionable chats w the CS. They always have a hard time understanding my problems. And they ended up being non-solutive and referred me to the email CS. So I just wasted my time trying to talk to them then? When I shared about this, turns out my friends have had unpleasant (and not solutive) experiences w the CS too', ""I love the convenient pockets feature, extra card security (safer than Jenius with more fine-tuned controls), and option to open a syariah-compliant account, but the app itself is still rough around the edges. I get a lot of repetitive/delayed notifications, and edits to my spending analysis usually don't save on the first try."", 'Almost a year using JAGO, tried multiple digital banks, I personally think JAGO is still the best one so far. Not that long since JAGO added QRIS, but it seems like QRIS format has been evolved, would be great if you add ""Customer Presented Mode"" to your QR Payment. Other than that I\'m still hoping to have a way to do cardless withdraw and a way to deposit my money without going through third party, oh and PayPal support for Syariah. Overall it\'s a great bank, would recommend.', ""Hmmm I can't open Jago now. I'm using Android 13 and marked my phone as rooted (I didn't even root this phone). Please fix the issue and I will change back to 5 stars."", 'of all the digital banks that I have tried, this bank jago is one of the digital banks that I think is good. I myself say this of course is the reason, the reasons include the user interface or interface display is easy to understand and straightforward, there are no monthly fees and other administrative fees charged like conventional banks, a cardless system which in my opinion is good enough, as well as partnerships with online stores and other digital wallets and the QRIS system.', ""i was in silver level, but the physical card are a pain in the a** to use. everything's already perfect."", 'blocked my card without any acceptable reason. it said ""i have a failed subscription"" when i definitely don\'t. the only failed transaction was a week ago and it\'s not even a subscription. if your bank really cares and is secure, you would\'ve blocked the card immediately, not a week after. requires me to add some balance to reactivate the card, and when i asked what would they do with the fund, they didn\'t answer. don\'t even ask me to contact Tanya Jago because I DID and they DIDN\'T HELP.', 'I have just installed the new update less than 10 mins ago. I find it really buggy as it now takes forever to transfer money', 'This banking app has made managing my finances so much easier! I can quickly check my account balance and transfer money with just a few clicks', ""Overall it's a good app, the interface has improved but can be buggy at times. However, the customer service is quite bad, if we discover an account is actually a scam account, Jago won't temporarily suspend the account without letter from police officer. To me, Jago seems willing to protect those scams and had little commitment toward cyber crime, no matter how strong the proof are"", 'UI/UX arguably one of the best, the pocket system great to manage ur finance, the deposito sharia is just few tap away. The problem is, when I reach platinum member, I cant see the benefit detail, It just plain blank page Update : Jago customer service just called me to let me know that they will fix the bug in next update. They could just ask more detail via email, but they called me instead, To think they would called and make sure nothing wrong with my account is mind blowing. Good Job', ""It's well integrated to other apps like Gopay, Stockbit, and Bibit. And their saving account interest rate are way higher compared to conventional bank."", ""I've been using this app for over 1 year now. Love the spend analysis and the pocket so i can distribute my money. Never have huge problem until yesterday, i send money to different bank account, for almost 24hr my money did not send successfully, it said still ON PROGRESS. Why it take so much time to send money? After i contact the staff, they said to wait for another 1x24. Huh, already lost my patience and my money didn't even back yet! So 1 star for me."", ""Akhir2 ini banyak masalah yang merugikan pemakai (some are compensated by Jago but some are not) Wil not use the app/service for a while, time to check competitor's product.."", 'Good service so far. Please add a feature to add notes on a transaction or add an ability to create custom categories.', ""I can divide my money into different pockets. That's great! However when I start to divide them into the pocket, the app will become slow. I need to restart and kill the app when I try to distribute my money into the pocket :("", 'Just great. responsive and versatile app. and no need face confirmation during registration.', ""Cannot take selfies when creating account. Seems like the app can't recognize my front camera. Fix this and I will update the rating"", ""Since 2 weeks ago it is keep force close, so I can't transfer my money on it. I have been updated it, re-install, and even restart my phone but it doesn't work. Meanwhile other application in my phone keep working very well."", ""Can't make a Digital VCC, I don't know why tho it's stuck. Please fix it. My connection is good."", 'Jago successfully giving a really great experience about digital banking. But, I think Jago needs improvement to make it really easy when we are going to pay with QRIS. QRIS is a common payment method in Indonesia and Bank Jago until now still not provide this kind of service. Well, the current solution is transfer our balance to Gopay, but I think it can be more flexible with just doing this all activity in Jago app.', ""It's such nuisance whenever I accidentally swipe back, the app just closes like that, it's not secure."", ""Tried several digital banking apps but this one's my fave! Great design & love the pocket system, esp. shared pocket 😍"", ""There was a problem like it didn't update my balance information in real time that made me worried I lost my money. Sometimes it takes almost half the day to do transaction to other bank account. But so far I enjoy using it. Hope you'll do better in the future, keep it up. 💪🏻"", 'Great app. Feature suggestion: add the ability to add widget to phone home screen to pay by QR (neobank has this feature)', 'great apps.. imho, QRIS must be shown at Payment option or center of Home to make it easier to use. well done Jago team🤩', 'So lagging for updating my money, although the mutation was written. It was risk when I want to use it for buy food and beverages', ""App keeps getting heavier. You will probably end up like other bank in near future if you can't fix it"", 'the application display is easy to understand, and very helpful. Cool', 'Excellent! Jago is the best modern banking in indonesia. so far very statisfying, keep it up.', ""too much tutorial from beginning, maybe I'm new, but good overall, keep it up and make it more simple please 👍🏽"", 'Very good banking app all around.

But, in the tab almost all the fonts were cut out in half. I cant see the top half of almost every number and words. I think because it is not compatible with tab display. Now i have to move it to my new phone to avoid that, but the moving process is a bit inconvenient. It is good for safety reason tho. The font on live chat is white, cant see what we type. The agent just said to update but no new updat', ""despite of a bunch of good features you guys provide, it is useless when we can't access the app smoothly. it took ages to access the menu. i could say that only half of my entire transactions went smoothly with this app. sometimes i couldn't use the app for an entire day. sometimes the fingerprint didn't work, and i have to reset my pin eventhough i input it correctly. please fix this asap, i've been using this app for more than a year but i don't see any significant improvement."", 'Long story short, at first, this app is very convenient. After a few tweaks and updates, it is so hard to see my saver balance without it have to be refreshed over and over again. The ""failed to upload data"" notification keeps coming and it really frustrates me when I need to do an immediate transfer or checking. Shouldn\'t have gone from hero to zero.', ""the services are good. the features are good. but the app performance is terrible. it's so slow, takes 10-30 second just to open a new page. the errors often occur too. I've been using this app for almost 2 years now, and they still haven't fixed this issue since then. I thought that this version would be better than the last version, but it's just as slow. it's frustrating. they should put users comfort their top priority instead of just pretty user interface."", 'I used to love your app and been using it for years. I think you used to have the best saving programs and it was so easy to navigate within your app as well. However since the last UI update, your app has been considerably slowing down, the UI is kinda confusing to navigate too. I think your old UI is way better, if you could change back, it would be awesome', ""This is maybe the right time I have to tell the team. I've been experiencing freezing and extremely long time to load the app. Even from the pin/fingerprint log in. It's often to not be able to open the In/out menu to see the payment history/prove. Please fix this problem and I think there's such a big problem with your server or something. The speed is badly slow. Love the features, but you guys have to consider the user experience & usability more."", 'Such a frustrating service. It says ""Your session has expired"" everytime I tried to login, whatever that means. Tried to login to the website and it\'s been on ""maintenance"" for forever without any ETA. The app itself is frustratingly slow and bloated to use. A big service such as this shouldn\'t have this many problems. Edit: The UI better and faster now. One thing I dislike is the 1 device limit. I\'m actually ok with it, if they make it easier to unlink besides calling call center.', 'It is highly not recommended to use this application, especially to open an account here, after the ""BIG"" update that changed the UI/UX appearance of the application, there were lots of bugs and lags during use. Not only that, the service for checking transactions also takes a very long time, especially during maintenance which requires us to wait a long time and there is no warning or notification beforehand if maintenance will be carried out. Not recommended !!', 'Previous UI simply better and more easy to understand. When you seek something, it\'s basically on one tab on the left side menu. The problem is only that the information are too packed together in one page. Today UI is kinda childish in design, like there\'s no consideration in ""Speed"" and ""clarity"", yes it is more simple, but quite disorganized compared to previous UI.', ""It's a good app, revolutional. The downside is, I don't like how I have to call the call center just to unlock my device when I want to move the app to another phone. It's just so unnecessary, time consuming, annoying, and it consumes money (pulsa) to call the call center. Other banking app can do just fine without annoying step like this."", ""The app is very laggy compared to other m-banking app I've used (BSI and Living). Loading the screen lock, loading the home page to properly appear, and when switching between menu takes a very long time. It makes for a very frustating and inconvenient experience. Especially when I need to finish a transaction quickly. My intetnet work just fine."", 'I give up on registering an account via this app. I did it twice but still failed. The call center sounds helpful but solving nothing at the end. I think the problem is not the stability of the Internet connection, but your app is too heavy. This makes the account verification difficult. I rarely leave a review on this Google play. This might be because I do want to use Jenius, but the experience itself is too bad.', ""This apps is useful and the interface is great. But sadly though the network is just too unreliable. I can't make any transactions today and it's already been difficult to make transaction before. Its saving grace is only that the service charge is free, so 4-stars. Hopefully jenius will be much more reliable when they start charging their customer. If not, then I'll look for their competitors."", ""Do NOT ever open the account or even install this app. I tried to transfer my balance from this not-so-genius app to OVO, and all I got is there is the problem with my internet connection, while I can do other transactions. What kind of service is this?? This doesn't happen only once or twice, it happens almost EVERY TIME. It is so annoying, I usually a straight person, if your service is good, 5 stars there you are. But this time? Nah, I would give zero star if I can."", ""I used to love this app so much, but since the last update the UI seems so heavy and slower. It's really bothering when you have to send money but stucked in the main page. Worse, this happened after the feesible thing taken every month. No, I did'nt paid monthly fee for a slower and ineffective app like this. We don't really need new UI, we want simple and dependable banking experience."", ""Amazingly slow performance and always failed to activate my account. When it comes to be connected to video call, the apps was force closed at any time I tried. I followed the operator to try many times. Now, I refuse to try again. My phone works well with another banking apps even to make the same video call or stream HD video. If it is possible to rate 0 star, I'll do."", ""The service itself is good, it makes saving and managing your money easier. The problem is the app, it is so slow, so clunky, especially with the new update. I couldn't even log in. If you're in a rush, you'll lose your temper waiting for the app to work. Frankly we don't need an update of the UI, the old UI worked just fine. We need the app to work faster and more stable. Edit: there were 2 updates after I write this review, but still no improvement."", ""Good system, good offer. UNFORTUNATELY, the app is very slow most of the time. Too many loadings. After inputting PIN, need to wait 10 seconds. Then need to wait another 10 seconds for the dashboard to load. Then need to wait another longer for other operations. I suggest instead of spending the money on numerous booths, billboards, etc.,invest in creating a smooth app first. Hope to see improvement in the next update. It's a shame such a good app is destroyed by a laggy, slow navigation."", ""The apps performance is really bad, super slow. It keeps on loading for more than 30 minutes. I often face difficulties to open the apps. Once it is opened, it only displays loading screen so that I can't use any feature. The flexi saver and dashboard is often show wrong balance such as 0. The bank charges Rp10k every month just for a service like this. The process for closing account is also uncomfortable. Please fix either the apps or the procedure to close account. Thank you."", ""I thought by updating the app to the newest version, I can use the finger print log in easier. But no! It's still not working. This version loads more data than the previous one. It make the app's loading longer, more than 5 seconds, and make me as user uncomfortable. I don't like the new design. It's dominated by white colour while Jenius logo is dominated by blue. I slightly see blue color in this app. I hope you can be better so I won't move to other digital bank. Thx"", 'Everytime I change my debit card limit it will automatically change itself to a certain lower amount. My subscription has failed the payment due to this issue even though I have enough money. On top of that, somehow now I cannot change my card limit and it just shows me a white screen of death. Are you doing this so you can charge me extra fee for the failed payment? I am frustrated, this is NOT cool! Fix your app!', ""In theory, this app/product could be a great payment solution, especially for those who doesn't have access to online payment method. But, the system is hardly reliable, logging in to the apps take time, card verification failed. It's just not dependable. The CS team is super slow when it comes to handle complaints. And there is also some annoying UI that ask whether you're still want to chat while it's the CS that takes an awful long time to reply. Disappointing 1/5"", ""After inputing PIN, sometimes loading the homepage fails and I have to input PIN again, though this happens intermittently. I had this trouble one time where I can't top up my Flexi Saver, the topup success message displayed, the topup is also recorded in the transaction tab, but the amount on the Flexi Saver UI and my main balance stays the same. Other than that, this app is wonderful."", 'I have a good experience with the app, but this time, it seems like there\'s a bug in the UI. When i do nothing, the text ""IDR"" in the home screen shrinking by its own. The same happens with text ""KARTU DEBIT"" in the cards screen. It\'s a minor bug for me, but i hope it will get fixed soon. Overall, the app is good and usable.', 'It\'s been 4 months and currently have issue of everytime I open apps, it\'s always ""Jenius sedang menyiapkan data"" all the times and it take some time. Then there are so many bugs of notification that my transaction is failed but actually it\'s successful. Well it makes me a little bit upset. Please fix it, the saving rate is already decrease and I won\'t disappointed with the system too', ""Update: Unresponsive during pin input to access the app (spoiler: it cannot be accessed). Terrible experience during online payment. The money was transferred but the well known travel agent did not receive the payment. Sluggish performance and lower interest rate every now and then. It's okay to pay Feesible but please make the interest high as it used to be. Thankfully it still offers online debit for accessibility. Kudos to the customer service for fast response."", ""The idea of Jenius is incredible. But can i give a reccomendation? I think its user interface is not handy for all people. And for me, sometimes it's hard to find top up menu. Lastly, the app sometimes performs a bit slow when moving to another menu so maybe some improvement may mean a lot. Thank you Jenius, such a brilliant breakthrough for us all!"", 'Sorry I have to give this app 1 star review. So, recently I\'ve moved the genius app to my new phone and suddenly I can\'t do log in?! I\'ve been trying for so many times, but everything is the same, when I input the OTP numbers, it says ""your session has expired. you are now logged out automatically"" hell! Please do your job properly to fix this problem. And I refuse to go to the branch office, because this is a problem that you guys the developers can fix it. Thank you.', ""Everything is fine, but the session management is really bad. Sometimes I opened my app, and browse through the menus for about a minute and then suddenly I have to insert my PIN again. Seriously, please fix this. And one suggestion, I think the timer when you're displaying your card information is too fast. Please extend it a little bit, sometime users wants to check the card information back and forth before confirming any payments to avoid mistakes."", ""After updated, the connection become more slowly. I tried to open other apps like ig, tt, fb, etc, it's running smoothly and fastly. I think the problem is from Jenius apps, the connection is very slow, i can't open jenius dashboard, save it, etc, all of it, it's just loading loading error, and then try again, loading, error, and always like that, please fix it!!!!!!!!!!!"", 'Top up e wallet is more often than not, a hit and miss. And the app will still record outgoing transaction in the In and Out eventhough the transaction was not succesful, which is confusing for record keeping. Also, loading time for getting in the app and some features takes ages, and sometimes it leads to crashes. Does the app becomes bad after BTPN acquired by SMBC?', ""I have only two issues with this app. The number of times it kicked me off the app randomly and its miserably slow loading speed. It didn't crash, it simply stop. Otherwise, the UI/UX and features it provides accomodate my needs perfectly. Three star until the annoying issues are fixed."", 'Very useful m-banking application, easy access, easy regristration and the UI/UX design make it simple to use. I can top up to many e-wallet with just one application and transfer to another bank for free. The financial management feature is great, my bills become easier to pay such as internet, electricity, or even top up my spotify and netflix account. It helps me a lot during this pandemic to do online transactions anytime anywhere', 'Very laggy. Very slow. And the customer service on twitter says that we need to clear data and cache if it lags. But as it lags everytime i need to use it, so i have to clear data first before hand. EVERY SINGLE TIME. It is so unreliable. Considering this app handles all private financial data of mine, i hope the developer will prioritize making the app faster and more reliable as well as secure.', ""Very slow and very lagging compare to other apps. UI and UX sometime confusing and not clear what, why, when, and how. And it easily put me out of the app while I was looking for number or another bank account for seconds. It's an annoying app. Edited in response to BTPN : Yes, my internet is stable and very fast. I use fast internet (broadband) from Indihome. Many reviewers also said the same about the slowliness and lagging of Genius. Please improve that, BTPN."", ""Been used around 6 months. When I just joined, around 2-3 days after, at night, I got an error, says something about login session expired. The issue persist until tomorrown morning. I called CS and they say no issue with systems etc, exactly on the same time, when I do check to login, and it still error. Apart of that, all seems good and lately their system didn't have any error / slow loading. But, unfortunately, I decide to close my account, since I'm afraid same thing happened again. :("", ""I can't even open a new account. I don't know what to expect. Edit: In the end I need to create my new account using different email and phone, which doesn't really make sense, because I'm able to change the email and phone to my previous attempt later after the registration process was done. The experience is smooth afterwards. Although there's a room for improvement, like making your x-card be part of subject of interest calculation, I'm quite satisfied overall."", 'I can\'t even begin to fathom on how bad the service is. First, they won\'t allow you to log back in to your account after resetting your phone or after getting your phone stolen for ""security reasons"". Not only that, the process to get your previous device unlisted is a nightmare, especially if you don\'t remember the specific details for your latest transaction with them. Not only that, they had the gall and audacity to charge 10,000 IDR/month for this kind of service. Y\'all flopped!', ""I don't know why this is suddenly happening to me. I never have any problem with Jenius Application before, I know that it was always slow in responding when you try to open your app, but this thing happen to me now, never actually happen before. So, I really want you to help me. I couldn't sign in into my own account. Everytime I try to sign in then set my pin, it always said that my session is expired, so I logged out automatically. I already try to uninstall the app but it didn't work either."", ""The features are great, and older versions of the app used to run smoothly. However, these past few versions are so bad I can't even login, and when I do, the app is so slow I'm quite hesistant to do any transactions in case my funds get stuck on an error. From the social media comments I'm not alone on this, so please fix the app!""]",com.btpn.dc,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.btpn.dc&hl=en&gl=id

My issue is that it's draining so much battery. I'm using the app maybe once or twice per day, and I force close the app after each use. I also restrict background and foreground activity of the app. Still it consume more power than any other app/game. The UI and features are useless with this issue, never would have changed from the blue app if Mandiri didn't shut it down. Moving to another digital bank for now."", ""The previous version was FAR better than this. It takes forever to upload the transfer list. When it finally appears, somehow the account doesn't come out as easy as the blue version. It lags most of the time, especially for transfer transactions. One time I had to log out more than 5 times only to make 1 simple transfer. PLEASE kindly fix this issue. It is NOT convenient at all."", ""Couldn't agree more with the unsatisfied reviews, such a downgrade from the blue version. If you decide to come up with a new version, it should be more advanced than the older one. With this new version I can't even make payment to certain merchants. I have actually avoided using this version 'til one day the blue version is no longer working on my phone. So dissapointing, to say the least."", ""You think it's an upgrade from the blue one, it is not. It looks like it offers shortcuts meant to be efficient, but truly it is not. I don't need those unnecessary upgrades when I can't even top up my shopee, shame. I prefer simplicity and efficiency in use rather than just uh, good looks... Duh."", ""It was working fine until today. There must be is a terrible glitch in the app, as it keeps reloading the page, to update emoney card info. Thought it was an issue with my phone, so I restarted a few times. When problem continued, I uninstalled, then reinstalled & registered my info again, but same thing happened. If it doesn't work again, I will have to sadly make a trip to the bank and get help from customer service. Wish me luck!"", 'Not even worth giving 1 star. To be honest the UI is much cleaner but that\'s all the praise I can give. I\'ve been trying to open the app for the entirety of the day and it has yet to open up. I wasn\'t sure if it was a connection issue so i tried several times using both my mobile data and wifi, both of which has no issue whatsoever. Is there a server error we the user were not made aware of? Everytime i open it a pop up saying ""Process cannot be completed"". Please sort this out.', 'Bring back the Blue version! This version supposed to be an upgrade not downgrade, but the experience said otherwise, bloated with promo and unresponsive UI, loading too much just by getting to other menu section, overall not a very nice experience. The Blue one is much to the point and better in any possible way, this one not even have a dark mode for God sake!', ""I've only used the blue Livin' by Mandiri for a small amount of time before switching to the gold one yet I can say I'm quite disappointed. Interface isn't user friendly, their services are clustered/ categorized so it can be hard to find the specific thing you're looking for. Might I point out the amount of time I was unable to log in. This app is unstable. Thx to the discount offer they targeted to the largest consumer segment (bts fans), the app hasn't been working whole day. Fix this!"", ""Agree with the previous comment, the blue one is better. Every time I open the application, either to view balances or make transactions, my cellphone immediately hangs for a while. No response and can't press anything. I already clear the cache, clear the data & re-registration, still not working. Please fix it soon. Large and well-known banks like Mandiri should have stable and better applications. Thanks..."", ""Edit: UI is a bit confusing and rather missing minor details. For example, if there's a input box (for nominals, texts, etc.), please highlight it at least with faint/light shade of grey to differentiate it with background. Otherwise some people won't know how large is the touch area is or won't even realize you actually can touch it to type (like my previous review)."", 'This is worse than the blue apps and shutting down the older version to forced customers switch to new version when the new version is still unstable and lack the features available in the old version is what happened when customers are not the priorities of the bank. All my settings and favorites account set up are not carry over to the new version, I have to set it up again one by one. Waste of time', ""Very frustrating, spend hours just to register. This is 2022 and you still need us to go to your office just to verify?? Edit: Just switched my mobile number to the one I've registered before, and voila, it works. Definitely better than the blue version. But, the experience is a little bit smoother in the blue one."", ""For users like me with tight storage problem, the app runs very slowly to the point where I struggle to type my password correctly because my hand typing isn't slow enough. The blue version loaded so much faster despite facing the same storage problem, and this issue never occurs with the other mobile banking app. It has a nice UI and some new features though."", ""the app is weird, took too much memory. the interface was terribly not user friendly. it getting me more confused everytime i need to make transactions because the options themselves is different from the usual. if you guys want a new user interface, at least don't change the options. keep it like before. and also, it's so annoying to know such this app has a notif ads which is make me hard to see my other notifications. bring back old ver (blue logo)!!"", ""This app not as good as the blue one. The blue one is more concise and practical. I prefer the blue one tho. This yellow app seems more complicated in face-design. even when we want to do simple task such as transferring money, it requires more effort than the blue one. I really want to go back to the previous app, but yeahhh the notif to change into this app is damn too high 😫, even if I don't want to, I have to change into this yellow so that I can use mandiri mobile banking."", ""So far so good lots of usable feature I need like quick look of transactions and quick ewallet top up, with lots of authentication and confirmation page which is good to take a second look at my transaction. I hope it doesn't suffer problems like the old Livin'. Like re:re:re:re:register every minor update or sudden register while nothing changed on the phone."", 'I\'ve just shifted from the blue one to this after all of the annoying pop ups that read more like threats. Today I can\'t even access the app. It says ""try again later"". You can\'t tell me it\'s the connection, when at the same time I watch 4k videos just fine. This is the reason why put off switching for quite some time. Do something about it will ya.', ""Worst banking app I've ever used. Notifications always comes late, even days after transactions. It's impossible to see details of past transactions. I can't even see the sender name and account number for deposits coming from different banks. I can't even add my own gopay and other ewallet if the phone number is different. Some feature straight up crashing the app."", 'I still prefer the Old Livin one, since my muscle memory was there, and easy and quick. But now it\'s just.. I\'d say better, lot more intuitive, and user friendly, but yeah, just need sometime to adjust my muscle memory. Quick suggestion, maybe you can in Inbox just like a ""Mark as read"", so I don\'t need to click manage and then select, AND then mark as read, AND apply it... took a lot work. oh, and add a quick download reciept button too, rather than scrolling down. besides that, perfect!', ""There is a bug where i can not quit from the transfer receipt page. It's annoying that i have to force close the app at the end of every transfer or puchase. edit : For real, i've uninstalled and reinstall it again,but the problem still persist. The most annoying thing is i will be stuck at the transaction receipts for every single each transaction i have made. The only thing i can do is force close the app and go from the login again. Please just return the old version,it's more bug free."", ""In general the application works well. However, in term of security, it's different than the prev version. In the prev apps, the exact registered phone number is required to make the transaction, while in the new apps, any number can be used as long as there is internet connection. It's a bit concerning in the case of any user lose their phone (despite the password and all other things, it's still one less protection)"", 'in terms of compatibility and can be installed on the blackberry keyone it can. but after installing the problem, every time you open the application it is always automatically forced closed. Are there really no improvements in terms of device adjustments or are the developers from Livin themselves indifferent? Twice I complained via email and application comments were simply ignored. very disappointing', ""Fix your app, go find a better developer! It doesn't make any sense, why every time I try to do face verification it is always failed? I already follow the instructions very carefully. My phone also more capable to finished any verification from other bank applications. This is really frustrating. I never imagined how come a famous bank like Mandiri cannot afford to provide a better mobile banking application with lesser bug."", ""Can't transfer due to error of the number buttons in the window of typing the amount of money. When a number tapped, it displays the number. But when the second number tapped, it replaces the first one. Imagine you must top up your LinkAja that you can transfer money to an account of Bank Mandiri. Funny right? I cleared cache, yet still doesn't work. I installed Livin in another phone of mine, still same. Friends and family do not face this problem. Only me. I chatted the BM WA, but no solution."", ""1 star until you moved the log out button out of the bottom right corner. That's a very awkward design choice, ESPECIALLY if it's not there before. Update: Still there half a year later, oh and further inconvenience: when making payment, why do we have to search for the categories? Why can't we just paste the VA number and the app auto select the category? We won't have this problem if you don't remove Multipayment category by the way."", ""This most recent Update is a complete desaster. Every time I used it the app won't open next time. I have to de- and then re-install which requires verification at an ATM. I am completely frustrated now and consider moving to a different Bank. It is so annoying."", ""It's weird that this app always know what you need in a critical moment such as : In the middle of the night? Need to top up your emoney? Don't worry, we're under maintenance for some reason. Yes, we will draw money from your account but we will update it the next morning. Meanwhile, enjoy being stranded on your journey. Maybe you can upgrade your core system."", 'This app made me easy to do all my stuffs, especially when I have to pay. Its QRIS is very responsive. One thing that amazed is it also provide a kind of tabungan berjangka and the amount is counted base on our need. If you want to invest your money in obligations, they also provide it. Happy to install this app.', 'Your login button is a mess. I always need to tap at least 3 times for it to be clicked. And the OTP always comes late while other apps OTP is fine.', '[EDIT] The App Access and stability issues had been resolved. Thanks [/EDIT] • Since early this morning, Livin\' by Mandiri was completely inaccessible. The App said: ""Belum berhasil terhubung. Kami sedang mengecek hal ini. Silakan coba lagi atau kembali beberapa saat lagi ya"". I tried multiple times to login in the last 6 hours, and nothing changed, kept stucking on the error page. Please fix this bug, or whatever it is, to restore the trust of the customers and to gain higher ★rating. Thank You', 'Every time they update application we have to keep re-typing our data..sucks...watch for hidden fees in both your debit and credit card (dont use instalment using cc mandiri, you are in for a ride)..pay pln also more expensive than bca..bumn to bumn harusnya lebih murah malah lebih mahal..this is also the worst virtual account payment..you cant just type va number and shows up..6 steps for a simple VA payment..unbelievable', 'Oftenly bug and cannot login the account. Please mandiri upgrade your apps. We are consumer need a faster apps when we open it anytime.', 'Useless Apps. IT should help to make job easy when we do reapet payment but with this Yellow Apps need more time than when we do manually. This is not even for 1 star. See provider will only say sorry for inconvenient without doing anything to improve. 😞', ""Worst banking apps.. sometimes can use without any problems..but for a couple of weeks can't used normally.. always failed to access any transactions.. always ask to go to settings and check the automatic times..do it all the times and reset the phone again..then ok..but next can't work properly again..""]",id.bmri.livin,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.bmri.livin&hl=en&gl=id

Please don't ever take that away since that's one of only a few other advantages you have. Better start working on adding other features asap.
