But not everything. This happens to me rarely but, whenever I'm in a game, the screen suddenly it glitched and there we're rainbow pixels up and down the screen. The shoot, jump, slide, and the inventory button was gone. Luckily it only lasted for a bit. I don't know if it's a problem with my device or what. Then I quit a game before the enemies score was 50 so I quit when that happened then I was still in the game."", ""the game itself is great. i love the high quality graphics and concept of this game. however, there are lots of bugs every new releases. also, the map is slowly turning into an advanced futuristic world, which i don't really like at all. the game should have a realistic battlefield so that we could envision what it's like to be a soldier. places like: bunkers, forests, ghost town, lakes, desert, abandoned houses, military camps, unfunctional submarine, etc. should be added."", ""The game is good but i feel so jealous when I play with my friends because they were using high and device and they can see enemy from farther. But it's playable on my phone but sometime it's frame dropping but it's Allright because it just a little frame drop. Please fix the low end device snowboarding because we can only do one jump on snowboard and the other device can do a lot of jump. Thank you"", ""i really like the game since i first installed it 3 months ago. the only thing that is making me furious is that it keeps adding me to matches that have already started especially to the losing teams. there are no days that i'm not added to matches that have already started or to losing teams. good thing i manage to win sometimes but i often lose cuz of the losing team that i was added to. overall, this game is good, i love the quality and graphics and i can still manage to be mvp or win a match"", 'Have been playing this game since its release in 2019. Devs really do listen to bug reports in the in game settings just make sure to screen shot it or record it, been doing it since... I once reportEd a bug that ""when you parachute or glide into any window you would end up stuck and An no matter what you do you had to Be downed or killed just to unstuck""... And it was fixed i know the chances of doing a glide or window drop is hard but it is awsome when campers gets surprised.', ""The game is good, I just hope the devs could add a section in the inventory which allows you to view everything including owned weapon of having to go through each weapon individually. Also I hope the devs would allow us to permanently delete items we don't like or want, there are still event items from the past stuck in my inventory."", ""I've been playing this game for a while now and i have been encountering a few bugs sometimes and it really ruined my gameplay as it is one of the main reason why me and my team loses a game, though these bugs can be an obstacle to the players, it isn't worse than you think,it occurs sometimes but later on it won't be noticable. Overall it really amazed me that the graphics is really good, the controls are easy to use and the mechanics is also easy to understand, love the game"", ""When you get to a higher rank they put trash teammates plus the snipers are broken when. You shoot the head or body it does no damage at all if you did successfully hit the enemy it only do a hitmark even the head and plus the game glitch were you can sometimes see the enemy though walls and many more and it take forever to find. A match whit You're friends it sometimes go to 1~56 second or even more to find a match if you do you network will be gone when you have good network connection 😔"", ""I didn't recommend this in low device so low quality in graphics,there's many disadvantage of low device,you can't see enemy when it's far,you can see enemy only if your closer with enemy,the characters skin and guns you can't see it unless you have 64 gb,if you have 32 gb and 3 RAM lower,so many bug and many disadvantage,so please codm fix it,I'm so disappointed for this not fair game,fix it codm please, instead of enjoying the game we get disappointed because of unfair treatment. FIX IT PLEASE"", ""This game is way better than the others. The guns, maps, everything is good. One thing, please bring back some modes. For example, the battle royale night mode, and even the og undead siege. That's all, and pleasee i want it back."", ""I've played codm since season 1. Back then, it used to be really good even for a mid budget phone. I'm using a powerful chipset with Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, and this game has frame rate and heating issue in Battle Royale mode 🤦\u200d♂️ I'm getting really sick when fighting with real players and then frame lags like crazy. This game is getting far worse than my expectations, utterly disgusting"", ""My experience on playing Call of Duty®: Mobile - Garena is decent and playable but I encounter issues such as fps drops, unbalanced gameplay in ranked multiplayer, and high giga bytes of storage consumption on my device. These issues really affects my gameplay though my device is running smoothly or maybe the game is not well optimized. I hope these issues that I've encountered soon be optimized and I honestly rate the app 3 stars! though I could have rated it higher but with such issues."", ""I want to request something about the dlq333 can u givie it faster adss and if you can you can lower the recoil of it that will be great the Sr is slow ads right now and also it has a big recoil into it it's hard to use it and also can you make new shotgun it's been a long time since the jak 12 came out. The game is great needs more improvement but it works perfectly."", ""The game is good and it has a good graphics and it's not hard to play for a beginner like me but I think if you add a ques like an event like if a player choose a skin like epic or legend they will have to complete the task before they get the skin they want. Plsss consider this 🙏🙏🙏"", ""I love this game very much, I've been playing for 3 years now and the experience of these game is really good, great maps, great gameplays, better rank ups etc. But because only four stars I rated it.. I have to downloads the resource packs when the season ends. That is my only info for this game, I hope in the next season it will be great update, and still love this game one of the greatest mobile game I've ever experienced.."", 'The point that i gave it a 3 star because it isnt optimized for other phones specially mine. It keeps crashing and putting my rank at risk when i disconnect from a ranked lobby. Please optimize your game for us low to mid range phones. But the game is very good overall.', ""Good and challenging but the problem is The BUG sometimes my cursor (aim) is good but didn't hit the enemy or sometimes i hit them but they slide before they get killed (it's like delay or something) and also other one is my gun cant fire, although i click the fire button but still the ammo wont come out i thought my phone was the problem but i asked my friends and they told me that it's a bug and sometimes happens to them, please fix it, i prefer the old version"", 'Bad experience i just got a little bad network and suddenly call of duty gave a notification for me to quit and restart the game and i was playing ranked wich made me lost a lot of points this is ridiculous! The developer should not automatically let matchmaking players enter an in game so fast since players that lost connection can still go back to the game for a short period of time please fix your matchmaking! Please wait for one round until the player that left the game can go back.', 'Overall the game is great I love the COD franchise but can you add a ""are you sure button"" when changing your controls because I accidentally clicked ""Reset"" and instantly reset my controls and it effected my gameplay so if you fix this issue I\'ll happily rate 5 stars I have a pretty bad memory whenever it comes up to this type of games', ""Hey! Game developers! What's wrong with you? Too many updates! In play store and two other downloads in the loading screen? Are you guys serious? The initialize loading screen will repeat 7 times before the comparing resources and another download? What's the catch? You cant make it in only one download? WASTE OF TIME!!!!!"", ""It's a really good game, I've been enjoying playing it for a while now, but I've noticed that recently, there has been this problem with the point counter not going up despite your team getting multiple kills already. It's really really frustrating, especially since it happens so commonly in rank, i hope this can be fixed."", ""the game is good actually but I encountered bugs, and the thing that makes it irritating was they keep on putting me into ongoing game. I can't really enjoy the game. sometimes in SND I need to wait to finish the first round before playing coz I was dead. I don't even know how I died 😣 CODM do something."", ""Idk why but it always freeze during the game the last time I played it was fine but now I just keep dying because it suddenly freeze for a sec causing me to always die these goes to BR,Multiplayer and Zombies I kept looking it up why it is doing it just says that I need stable and fraquent Wifi. And I am the only one using the wifi and it still keep going, I tried it with mobile data and it's still the same. If anyone knows what's happening pls let me know"", 'since this update, there are a lot of bugs, sometimes it crashes and the screen freezes. please fix it! one more problem, the file we had downloaded had to be downloaded again even though it had already been done also bad match making ! please make it fair ! are u reading this or you just ignore it ?', 'The graphics and resolution was the best especially after you released the new super resolution option. But then after the update, suddenly the resolution got worse even with the super resolution option turned on. Idk what to do and now my game looks worse than an offline game. Please fix.', 'its really good but sometimes its bad. Its about the sensitivity and the screen bug for low-end-device and the storage its so big, mine has around 12gb right now, and cant handle 4gb ram. but its really fun its just the bug the only problem. thanks (sorry for bad grammar i really tried 😭😭😭😭)', ""I love this game so much that I,'ve played this since 2019 I love the old memories and now it really surprised me of how many gameplay are gonna be added even some new smg's Just like the OTS 9 but, something happened one playing a normal cod mobile day started playing some ranked matches but, one game that turn my smile upside down I accedently press the wifi end then My screen returned to the begging screen where it first loads and then on the main menu but I didnt happen It froze my screen.."", ""Matchmaking in Ranked is terrible and unfair. Once someone on the opposing team has a Legendary or Mythic skin (and it's common on Ranked), it's almost as if it's an automatic loss. Desync is an issue too despite fast and stable internet connection. This game used to be fun to play."", ""an edit. the sniper scope problem seems to be okay now. the reason why I switched it to a 3 is because of the lag. my storage is decent, my wifi is good and yet, I still lag so much in game. moving the screen becomes extremely laggy, I lose rounds because of that, I die because of that, it's irritating. another thing is when I shoot the same time the enemy does, im the one that dies. i know that it should've killed us both so it needs to be more realistic. otherwise it's unfair."", ""I came back Playing with my new Phone so that I can enjoy playing CODM again however, everytime I open the game for the second time after downloading all the resources, it keeps crashing and won't let me play CODM,I already reinstalled it for the second time but it still the same. Please help me find a solution to this so that I can Play CODM again. I won't delete the for now,I'll wait for a feedback to fix this issue Devs, Thank you."", ""I want you to fix this,in my pov I'm sliding and but I'm still hit by the enemy,and when I review why I died,in the enemy's pov I'm still running into them, kindly fix this problem, it's really unfair,and lastly I hate the times that when I win only 30+ or 40+ is given but when I lose the minuse to the points is 50+ it's really unfair, because we're playing hard just to reach the rank but we can't because if the massive minus"", ""the graphics are good but the problem is, when you log in, it doesn't login automatically you have to login your account where it is connected, it also lags and if you go back to the game it just suddenly dies."", ""This game is so addicting like really. I have been playing this game since 2020, I just don't like how this game was very confusing due to the bugs that occur because of it. It always affect my gameplays and my strategies. This game is really cool. To be honest when I first played this game I was confused, but after a while I knew all the details, the ranks the games. Not like Mobile legends bang bang it is really hard to understand when you are a newbie."", 'Hi I have encountered a bug that it was understandable when never I went to loadout or email, when my phone freezes the names, nicknames all the mechanics changed into small, big, and spaced names I was very confused, but to restart the game. Ive encountered this alot I hope it will be fixed soon☺️. Thank you', 'Using S23 Ultra, can\'t use the scope and the fire button at the same time (currently using 5 fingers, Scope and Left Fire button are side to side) I\'ll change it to 5 when this is fixed, I\'ll play some rhythm games until you fix this. (Imagine on a S23 Ultra?) Edit: I already found my problem, I should\'ve just turn on ""fixed r-fire button."" Time to dominate... 😈', 'This game is really testing my skills! The game itself is fine. However, i have been experiencing screen issues. It lags and even freezes, it ruins my gameplay and it annoys me. With that, the game is unplayable. I have lowered my frame rate and graphics and it doesnt work. Just to add that the new update disappoints me. Whenever i slide, it just crouches. The game needs a little more improvement', ""To be honest, I like the original game when it was first released. I'm not opposed to adding some new designs, skins,emotes, maps and even characters in the game, but don't add new ones like every week. Please fix the errors and bugs first, and improve the game. The game occupies so much space and storage now, and a lot of my friends are uninstalling the game since their phone can't accommodate it's large size(like it's already at 18+GB)."", ""I used to love this game because of the good graphics. But something bithers me, I can't open CODM! Everytime I click it and the screen is loading, the loading would just stop and kick me out of the app and then return to home. I tried it many times but it still didn't worked. I can't reinstall it because the download resourcess would took me so long to wait again because of the latest update. I hope you can fix this, my wifi and storage aren't the problem."", 'After I updated the game it wouldn\'t let me go past the loading screen now, it only does like 2 of the ""validating resources"" thing and the game crashes.

But I do have just 1 issue, I just finished a game and had to say it out after I lost it 🤧 but, can you stop directing our next shots to the people we already knocked down, it's very annoying. Just imagine knocking down an opponent, ready to knock down the next and the bullets are hitting the downed opponent, giving chance for the opposite team to knock me down, that's beyond annoying. I've had this numerous times😭."", 'The game is really cool perhaps the best I\'ve ever played over a year now. It has cool graphics and game play... You won\'t regret downloading this game 💯%... I\'m giving it three stars to the reason that in my experience the game doesn\'t lag under good network connection but lags alot when hit by an enemy hence reducing your chance to fire back till you are died.

Now headset accuracy has made it so easy that even a new player can wear a headset. If the headset accuracy is restored as before, it will be fun to play. And another problem is that Gun max out skins and Guns..This process is very annoying and very bad if you remove them quickly the game will be more fun.', ""ove the game, but; first, the fact that u lose a star after every defeat is not good at all Secondly, the protection points are too slow to fill up, which in turn is the reason for my first problem, thirdly, it will not be so bad to add more gloo walls to the BR-Ranked mode, and it should be spread evenly on the map. Lastly, we should get good guns after round 2 in CS-Ranked, to avoid further defeat, cause at round 2 we can't upgrade many weapons past level one Everything else is 100%"", ""I've been playing this game for 4 years and a half. To be honest, i like this game because it's fun and challenging. But few things that I hate is when the old bundle get sell again. Also, the bug when i headshot an enemy and they still standstill. This problem still exist until this day and that slowly made my feeling to play this game fading. More than that, this game becoming pay2win time by time and that's not fair. I was hoping in the future it will become like old but gold version again"", ""Am giving this game 5 stars because the developers have done a great job on this piece of excitement, the controls are friendly and not too much buttons, the locations are classic the weapons are good to go... But I will like to suggest this because it has been bothering me and I don't know if it's only me.. I will like the developers to add like a jetpack and a slide button because been eliminated during falls is driving me crazy. Thanks"", ""I've been a player since you can't remember. And from the start, free fire is very smooth and have no lags or difficulties for me. But now, for the new update, it always made me left a match even though my internet connection is stable.

So please 'we' would really appreciate it if you add the 'fixed analog stick' option. Thanks."", 'Ive been playing freefire for a few years now and honestly its a great game. But, when shot on.... you die waaay too easily. To make the game exciting again damages taken upon enemy should eliminate your vest,helmet,etc. Before losing HP. Because no matter what level vest i wear,i get dropped as if im running around with nothing but a tshirt. I hope this review does not bring a negative impact to developers and maybe inspre with a new idea.', 'I played this game and I really enjoy it but I gave it 2 star for 3 things I really hate in the game 1. Network issues 2. Other players are too strong to defeat 3.

But, please can you improve the network stabilizer? It's very annoying when you tried to eliminate the enemy, but suddenly the ping is too high. Don't blame my provider I used, because it's fine for another online games. Well, keep up and I'm looking forward for another improvement of this game. Oh, one more thing. Can you make some age restriction? Because, I think it's not good for the under 15 year old kids and make the kids so toxic."", 'I am learning how to play the game.The only complaint I had is the skill setting.I think it would be so unfair for other players to play with opponents whose characters have skills maximum abilities. There are times when I played and I feel I have hit the enemy and scored but I was knocked down and lose the game.I would definitely suggest for the developers to add new modes for the CS ranked games. In terms of ranking I like that the stars are deducted.I really missed CODM and no issues so far.', 'The new update is awesome. It is simplified and covers everything necessary for gaming. The quick message features are really good but the controls are too sensitive. Teammates are weak af. When trying to play a game it automatically quits like twice before you can play. Fix the damn bug!!', 'This game is really nice. Been playing it for about a year now... Really loving it. But I am giving it a 5star because it has some extremely unrealistic part. Like when shooting there should be a kind of vibration on the gun that causes deflection when put at target not that the gun will be in the same position and still the bullets will be straying away from the target. Nice game by the way.', ""What kind of updates have you given to Free Fire? Many kinds of problems are that when the game is started, it automatically exits the game. If you tap on select mode, it takes a lot of time to load. It's not just me having this problem, there are many others who are having this problem. So I request you to fix these problems please. Gerina."", ""I started in 2018 and although the game's pretty good, I have to admit it's gradually going down the drain. I've always loved it though but there are lots of things that could be done to improve, Play store's review can't take them all For starters, bring back SSA server if possible, fix the proximity chat, and refresh our magic cube store please, Thanks 🙏"", 'Its great but it has something that i dont like, the battle royale. Its so annoying because the ammo and weapon some of it hard to get and make more defense places more so that its safer for new people. Other thing for me is amazing job. I like the map and all other things, its just the battle royale that you need to fix. Thank you!', ""It was a nice game before. Though the grafix was low, but people enjoyed playing it. But now it's not the same!! After the update the aim has become worse some times the controls does not work. Aim progression has become worse. There are many other problem you can see if you play."", ""I love the game so much everything in the game works so well and the art is very impressive I really enjoy but I'm giving it four star cause I think it'll be better if a player or the teammate will be able to shoot while the other is driving cause when I'm in that position, using a vehicle is pretty much not useful. and please change the way a character gun works cause i can't just be shooting a character that's already down when another is next to them pls help me with this"", 'I love this game so much, so interesting and relaxing but there is only one crazy issue which is the use of one shot, most of the time I play the game my opponent uses just one tap of whatever gun he/she holds to kill which is abnormal, and that does not make the game interesting to me sometimes. Please try your best to block anyone that uses the one shot to play the game so we the innocent can enjoy it better.', ""I don't know about anyone else but since the new update was released, I haven't had any interesting gameplay for 3 days straight. After the matching the internet connection reader in the game turns red, and I'm almost always killed by the unsafe zone draining my hp. And it wasn't like that before I downloaded the update. And I'm also certain it's not my network cos every other online game I play works just fine. I don't know what's wrong with it but you guys should pls check it out for me."", '1 ⭐ for network...can u do something to make it stable for all situations especially when I receive a call the game take long to reload (sometimes logs out) making me loose a star in both BR & CS ranks 1 ⭐ for character upgrading...the old upgrading system was fine until u brought in the system of using the same character for almost everyday and every match to earn upgrade point..please fix that. 1 ⭐ for protection points..takes too much time & so many matches to earn protection points.fix it', ""The first few months of it was working fine,then since last month i'm having high ping problems. As soon as I go near an enemy the ping suddenly gets high. Sometimes, the ping even reaches 999+. Which creats a lot of problems during gameplay. And the ping gets high mostly in ranked matches for which now i'm deranked to the bottom. I would appreciate very much if you fix tgis problem soon."", 'This is my first time complaining about this game though it is really good and fun to play, but I have been facing so many terrible issues in the game. First of all is the bad network I do face most time and it irritates alot because when am in a rank mode my network will be okay for some minutes and bam 999 and before I could reconnect again the enemies have killed me . My second problem is that I get mixed up with noobs sometimes and they are so annoying and slow .', ""This game really is good. I don't need to clearly point the hit marker to the enemies coz it will directly to go them when pressing the hit button. I liked the graphics of the game as well as the weapons. It's so wicked! Hoping others to enjoy it too."", 'Free fire. The game is actually interesting. You get to meet new people, make friends have a rival. But those hackers are disturbing the peace in free fire. Especially in mena server. That is where the are more. They make the game hard but actually it also helps in making us( the non hackers) to step up and improve ourselves. I actually had to step up my self. But the hack is not actually nice . Another is why is there no more linking of characters. Pls bring it back.', ""I wasn't happy since this new update because sometimes the game crashes out mid game logged me to the lobby and the game deducted my credit score and now I can not play rank matches due to low credit scores. it could be a technical issue. Please fix this before it happens to somebody else. Thank you."", ""I really don't have a problem with the game its perfect for me, however I think the developers should change the clothes in the redeem for the magic cube. It's been a while since anything has change in it. Otherwise from that it's a 👍"", 'I love the game, I just have a few things to suggest. Being able to carry teammates would helpful when the safe zone is closing, maybe a way to get them in a vehicle? Also, could duo mode be on the new zombies map? Again great game just some suggestions. 😊', 'In all this is a 5 star game but the skilled based matchmaking is frustrating.. I have been playing against full teams of high level players and a lot of low level teammates thats basically bots. You need to put all the players who costing you to lose games in one lobby. You all need to balance the teams!!', ""I've been playing this game for three years and it is far by most exiting as it has a variety of players with their own style of playing,ranging from noobs,pros,sweats,campers etc I've had moments were I thought of quiting because I lost alot but after a day or two I'd hop back,it may be addictive but that depends on the kind of person you are"", ""Free Fire is absolutely amazing the graphics the suspense the characters did I mention the graphics ❤️🤩 but seriously the only problem is the character's costume sometimes it doesn't change but trust me when I say it feels like your a fighter 👊🏾😹 especially when you team up with your friends talking with a mic it's just so fun 🙂"", ""I have a good experience. I have been playing this game for about 4.5 years. My reason for giving this review is because as the game is upgrading it's more full of glitches and the player with topup id's have all the advantages of those glitches means a no topup player can't even play. This game is becoming the perfect example of journey from good_better to worst. Highly disappointed 😔"", 'Well it is an amazing game . Nobody can question it. But it shouldn\'t be allowed to play with a hero league player in a ranked mode , if you are in the bottom rank, especially in Cs. Because of these ""players"" I lost a lot of stars when I was so close to become a master . They always have the least damage less than 500 mostly . Please take my suggestion into consideration . I m sick of these players who play with their hero league friends.', ""So far the game is enjoyable but I only have one problem. The footstep of my team and the footstep of the enemy are the same so sometimes it gets me confused so I hope the developer of this game fix it, and I'll give you a five star★"", 'I have been actively engaged in playing this game for over a year now. Unfortunately, the game developer has completely mishandled their game, causing significant issues. As a player from Nepal, I have experienced a drastic decline in gameplay quality ever since the game switched servers from India to Bangladesh. The high ping has made the game unplayable for me.

But it has terrible performance. With the not-so-gorgeous visual, i can't even play move in the match. I don't know what i want to suggest to the dev. I think the problem is my device. And i hope this game improve in the future."", ""Very good game, gunplay feels really nice, customizations r good. And VERY Smooth and fluid animations. I'll even put em up there with mw2019 One big issue I'm having is sometimes, the stutters a are unbearable. and there are a lot of times I meet this issue But when it works, its really good. I'm hoping y'all can address this stutter issue cuz the core gameplay is *mwah"", ""Im giving it 5* on the basis that it's new and the initial problems will be ironed out. Of the bat, this game is amazing. It's fun, fluid, and frankly frustrating, which In my opinion makes one of the greatest FPS games for mobile. Two major problems, though, is the movement being to fluid and not having a stamina and being able to scale buildings like Spiderman and never have to take a breath. Also, the addition of an ADS and shoot button is really needed as I play with two thumbs. Overall 9/10"", ""EDIT: The Game is good, beautiful graphics and animation. But the controls are a bit too spaced out for me. Many times I lose when I'm not supposed to. The right trigger button is a little high up the screen, making it a little more difficult when you increase the bot level. Please make available an option to customize the button positions the way I want. Edit: modifications disappear when I switch weapons. Have to begin the process all over again."", ""Levelling up is quite a pain. Might take a whiel. UI is not that bad, could be a little more friendly, but it's easy once you got the hang of it. Some clarification or like placemarker where you are navigating coule help but like I said, it's easy once you got the hang of it. A training ground could also help for experienced players from other games to tweak or edit preferences like control schemes, or sensitivity."", ""I love it it's fast paced and the movement are insane just a few problems some of the gun's feel sluggish and when adding attachment makes the gun even more sluggish than before there has to be a better way to fix this. Another one is that it's taking me a while to unlock now attachment I want to find out what I love using the most another one is that when I'm changing scope reticle I can't tell the difference because the cross hair is black and the background is black making it harder to tell."", ""I love this game! The movement is crazy, even on mobile. I've survived so many gunfights, often ones I wouldn't have survived in ANY other game, because of my movement. However, there are some minor flaws. For example, the TTK could be a bit higher, maybe 1.5x as high. Also, i glitched through some walls. One time, i got stuck in a wall on highrise. And please put this game on consoles. Like on PS4/5, Xbox One/S/X and Nintendo Switch. Especially the Switch needs a good F2P Shooter :)"", ""I recently just played battle prime and it was good but this game is even way better. I played it and it was an unbelievable experience. Very fun and exciting game to play. I would recommend it to my friends. Amazing graphics, cool weapons and skins to choose and it doesn't require much data. (Suggestion) Maybe you can add battle royale in, it will be very fun."", ""While it's good, I have noticed random lag spikes and frame issues that happen no matter what graphical setting I use, it may be my phone but it's only a year old, another issue is that you can't move the camera if you ADS and then click to move however if you click before ADSing it works just fine, these 2 issues are my main gripes with the game but other than that it's really good fun and very well made."", 'The movement was so fast, but I like it though the controls are the problem, I hope there are some settings where you can customize your control but overall it was a good game. And there are few maps. And maybe the developer might adjust the sprint of the characters they are just so fast. It might be manageable for others.', 'This is a great shooter game, the graphics are very good and the guns and movements are very good, but when we respawn, and please create more operators, especially free ones, but honestly guys, well done on the great work 👍👍👍, OK, well, I have found out how to change weapon sets, please make two battle passes, a free one and a premium, I dislike having to spend battle pass Xp unnecessarily, this game could become one of the best, keep it up', 'This game is good. It has good graphics and it takes only 1gb which compared to other shooter games,this game is alot lighter. This app should be available for TV boxs/Android box too and it should be keyboard and mouse supported if it comes on the TV box/Android box. There should be a prone mechanism as well. Edit: After the latest warehouse update I have been experiencing extreme fps drop on medium graphics. It goes from 49 to 10 fps while killing. This has never happened before. Please fix 🙏', 'This game definitely has potential to become one of the best fps games for mobile however there are some things that could be improved. Adding a tutorial would be good for beginners to fps games or just this game, being able to rotate the game the other way would help me personally a lot since my earphones get in the way of my fingers, and adding more customizability like more options and increasing the limit of the size adjust slider on the buttons would be nice.', ""I'm only giving this game a 4 star because I really enjoy this game on PC, and would like to support it. The mobile version is unplayable for me, because it has completely different controls to what I'm used to from a mobile shooter. I suggest adding an option to be able to aim and shoot with one button, which makes it much easier on smaller devices."", ""This game is awesome! It's just better to be more optimized in the next updates! The game has problems with range and sensitivity settings that annoy players. Please separate the sensitivity settings of sniper rifles and smg! This problem needs to be solved immediately because it is important for players! Thanks to the production team"", ""Currently it's an okay game, massive potential. The features are just like modern warfare 2019, i know it's been heavily inspired by it but it's good work. Anyways you need to improve alot. The maps are not good, there are barely any new gamemodes, it lacks realism and good game physics. The lobby interface is very depressing. Add a rank up system. To be honest, i know the developers are probably working hard, but for the same of the players , take inspiration from call of duty mobile"", ""Amazing Game!!! The combat is smooth,the controls are easy to master,you don't even need a tutorial because the action this game offers will have you feeling like a Fps master.Only have a few reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars..1)Npcs glitch like crazy,their arms fly around in the air as if their shooting down birds but then they somehow manage to land a hit....2)Whenever I finish a match in offline mode (Havnt played online yet) and i press play again or rematch then the game exits by itself"", 'This game plays great and very similar to ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare"" (2019) - after finishing customizing the settings for your play style. The recent update lets you use a gamepad controller - even you can use wired controller like a Xbox 360 controller with a otg usb adapter to play (haven\'t try a bluetooth gamepad controller yet). Overall, this game plays great and very smooth.', 'The game is fun and absolutely intense, but there\'s something I have been facing of, and it\'s the jump, slide, slide cancel abuser. So first, please add an cool down for the ""jumping"" one for like 3 to 4 seconds or you just decide the cool down for all of the things I complained:D. I recommend this game, it\'s really fun and intense and cool too, it has some daily challenges and other more stuff in the game and you should probably play this game!', ""Hi there! Alfa bravo, the game is great and I love it, I played it almost everytime I get a free time, but there's one thing I want to be fixed in game, and that is the, performance, you see my phone has 4gb ram and can run other demanding games fairly well, but Combat master... Lags very much I can only run the game at a max of 30-40 frames, and my fps gets lowered to 12-25 fps, Im already playing at the lowest possible graphics. Please optimize this game before releasing season 2"", ""I can't say much about the update. It's quite better than the last time, I think maybe fix the movement in the future update. Add Tac sprint button as optional. Auto-Tac sprint should be triggered only if the joysitck is moving straight forward (not horizontally only straight forward) nerf the strafe according to the weapon mod. Be true to the weapon modification cause sometimes the modified gun doesn't meet the expectation to perform well when in the match."", ""God, this is one of the best game so far, but I think there's still room for improvement. In my opinion, it would be great if the developers will add jump and slide fatigue as it would make the game feel more realistic. I also think that incorporating hardscoping specifically for sniper rifles would be a fantastic addition to the game, overall this is one of the most exquite and fascinating game i've ever had in mobile"", ""The game present a horrible bug in this last update, when im in-game playing at 60fps (just because 120hz devices are CURRENTLY not compatible) on Android, out of nowhere in the middle of the match it automatically changes the frame rate to 30 ... Don't know why this is happening, it did never happen to me in the past so, idk... I think it's an optimization issue. Please fix it, because the game it's UNPLAYABLE at 30, even 14fps when setting at 30 fps in setting... Cher's."", ""5 stars for now, i like how the combats fells. it's fluid, fast paced, responsive. Not deep into it yet, but it got good first impression from. Edit: drop stars, i don't mind grinding for account level, but weapon level are way to slow. 80lv each, at high level took awhile to level up, yeah. Sad to say, still no contender to CoDM."", ""The game itself is good, but the problem in this version is when using sniper rifle, I don't if it just me or I miss up the settings but its kinda hard to navigate on which direction I go, unlike the previous version its easy to use sniper rifle when navigating. I hope you guys solve this"", 'In my personal opinion, This game deserves an award. This has to be the best offline/online fps game I have ever played, The graphics are insanely amazing in overall there are still some bugs that needs to be fixed. Your game is great! Thanks for creating it.', ""I love the game it's laggy on my phone tho but it's fine, it's like I'm playing like codm, I can't wait for the new upcoming updates, i recommend you guys play this game it has nice graphics and you can also change the position of your controls, you can also play offline which is great because i can play without internet connection.."", ""This game is a master peice but the only reason I can't give this game a 5 star rating is because every time the battle pass says the new season comes out the timer restarts to 60 days every time. If you all could put an accurate time on the battle pass, that would be great. Other than that, this game is amazing. Keep up the good work."", ""Very Good game, it reminds me of one of my favorite games, Call Of Duty MW. It has a very huge customization, too. And I can connect to my controller to the game. But it has some huge problems the game isn't beginner friendly, and I want to enjoy the game, but the game goes against people who are like level 50, and I'm on level 3. It's already sweaty from the start, and u have to go against pc players when I'm on mobile. It feels too hard. And not fair and fun. Uninstalled."", ""I really love this game, it's unique from other offline fps shooter games I've ever played, 3d solid characters with an astonishing ways of reloading guns the best 👍 and as for the multiplayer I wish there could be a local multiplayer option to play multiplayer offline (WLAN) pls include this that's all I'm asking 🙏 in the update... You Guys Need To Consider This...."", ""I think you change and improve on how the characters jump and slide because when jumping while still on air I can press the crouch button and it will slide. It feels like it's unrealistic movement and how it climbs cuz it can still climb mostly every obstacles as long as it can reach. Climbing,falling,using ziplines,sliding should be a little bit more you know,like be more real. Everr movement isvery fast the character can be like a kanggaroo or a spiderman when climbing and using ziplines"", ""Ultimate game🔥. I would like to write directly to the point. (I've cut stars so that you can see it). there are many network issues, many glitches in between matches and in the weapon mods menu, it lags in the game and it sometimes freeze too, but good game at all, good as Codm or i say better than. Thank u for such beautiful game🎉💐. I hope yall will fix that."", ""This game is amazing. For people who want to try out this game be warned, because this fps is wayyy different then the others. This is a fast paced shooter, that means your gameplay will involve a lot of running (+shooting). It's definitely not for all people because the excessive movement can be really hard to get used to. However the game graphics, animation and UI is definitely on par with popular fps titles. It also doesn't even take 1.gb of storage+playable offline."", ""The game in general is good, offering decent gameplay, with the graphics and sound being very good, though the gameplay really has big issues due to the controls which neither are not good. The movement doesn't complement the maps, it is too fast and the maps are not big enough for the movement, i have to constantly stop at each step, because of how small they are"", 'Update!!!!!! They gave us the invert aim!¡!!!!!! The devs are listening to the community we need to support this game as much as possible to blow out call of dut! Would give it 5 stars if it had an option to invert my camera or at least my right stick. This is something that all mobile games look past, especially because this is on PC. There is no reason not to have invert Y Axies in the settings. Will change review to 5 stars if implemented. I can not play without invert aim.', ""Exactly like old school call of duty. Reminds me of black ops. It's got everything you could want. It plays buttery smooth, it has offline bots that you can level up by fighting, it has custom matches, and it has NO POP UP ADDS vying for your attention. You will even sometimes get a goofy reload which is always fun."", ""this game is nuts, there are a lot of problems. like when I only select arms race, it just throws me to combat master. so I try arms race, maybe it can help? nope, the same thing happens again. also horrible matchmaking system. I'm literally level 6 and the only players that are in my server are all tryhards that are level 50 minimum."", 'now yes the game is perfect and is the best knockoff game to exist. The guns, reloads, animations, and etc. feel smooth but the bots are very brutal, perfect accuracy and instakilling monsters and even when i set the bots to 1 they still have the instakilling weapons, perfect accuracy and very hard to hit atleast according to me who started playing again since 2020', 'This game is too laggy. Alot of cheater players, and alot of dirty moans when a player is killed. They should add more more maps, and needs more optimization to the game. It drains and overheats battery so quick. The gun firing sound should also be remastered. It sounds like a cheap toy. The the bots offline keeps spinning around...', ""Good graphics, but the controls are insane, you need fingers like pins, they're so close together you go to press 1 but end up pressing something else so you end up losing, should be able to move the buttons where you need em and how big you want em, because it's a fast paced game, you can't look around where you're pressing, it's too late by the time you know where to go and again they're too small.. Hopefully it gets fixed, could be a great game..""]",com.AlfaBravo.CombatMaster,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AlfaBravo.CombatMaster&hl=en&gl=id

Please fix the stability of the game."", ""I just comeback to this game yesterday. I really love the new contents, it's always amazing. But the problem is in the health system. It's so quick to kill enemies and to be killed by enemies. Sometimes it only takes 3 bullet hits to kill enemies and this also happened when the enemy killed me. Most of this happened in close combat which very annoying. Also, please make the recoil more easier to control and make the bullet longer to drop. Good job on the game :)"", ""Sausage Man is a good, fun, and friendly battle royale game. Some mechanics in the game are inspired by other games. But it has it's own thing that makes me want to come back and play it again and again. The game Become more fun and chaotic with friends so i'm highly recommend you to play with your friends. The issues I found is the frame rate issue which drops to 10 fps every 30 second (I'm playing in realme 6 128/4 btw). And rendering issue that very often."", 'This is a great and decent game. But, the sudden lag/freeze every 5 seconds is really annoying. Other people experienced this too when I read the review. Fix the ambiance sound too, for the example water/sea sound. When it stopped, it really stopped, at least make it loop so we can immerse more. On top of that, everytime the ambiance sound stopped, the game freeze again for a second. Fix this and the game will be actually playable and fun', ""It's fun, but not perfect, still theres room for improvement, of course.

Just wanted some variations of the way we can enjoy the game, and convenience purposes."", ""I really enjoy the game. Have funny emote, skin, and fun arcade battles. It's already Season 3/ T3, and I hope dev improve something that's still lacking : 1. New Map with medium size 2. Balancement of matching system 3.

The character design is brilliant and cute in the same time. The maps design are also outstandingly beautiful. Moreover the audio creation, I love the main menu background music so much.

Hoping for the future updates would fix these issues.

It's not like my device is that bad. I can tell when my device is struggling to run a heavy game it'll become really hot. But my phone didn't even get hot on this game, but the game keep freezing anyway. I would say freezing once in a while is fine, but the amount of the game frozen at exact moment when I need to do a clutch is way too much.

I've seen some people encounter the same issue as me when i check some youtube videos about this game. My phone uses a Snapdragon 845 and has 6gb of ram which i think is more than enough to run this game. I can run other games that's much heavier than this game smoothly without a problem. Please fix this issue ASAP and I'll change the rating. Thank you."", 'The connection is horrible, despite the voice call with my friends going on perfectly. The game also frames a lot, especially during essential moments of the game, and this problem never happens with other games.

And last but not least, the heavy bullets and innacurate shots that are clearly on target but never makes damage are driving me crazy. I give two stars because I believe you can fix this.', ""The game is really fun, the UI is good, the graphics is great, and the controls is good. But connection is the problem. I just got 150 ping and then the game kicked me out in the middle of the match idk why. It's bothered me that I almost got kicked for 3 times in 1 matches, and I played with wifi though.

Because of that I can\'t play, and I have to, or wait a very long time for it to fix itself or use a VPN some times, close it and open again without VPN. Besides that, it is a very entertaining & fun game, the graphics, mechanics and sounds fit just perfect. Good look with the development, I just want you guys to check that issue.', ""I encountered a bug. Everytime you wear AK-12 thr backpack suddenly gets full. Sometimes you need to drop the gun in order to fix the bug.

I look forward to another great game from you guys."", 'Another battle royale but wrapped with sausage characters. Lol. This is really interesting concept. Pros : the mission for season pass isnt really burdening you. You only need play a little bit if you want to achieve. Reasonable price for season pass and skin. Reasonable size game.

Why not add speed mode? More data gets used but better network. And also if the network fails, update it to something new which won't kick us out of the game but will let us stay at the game and everyone just stops. Thats just better especially for rushers and zone wars. Imagine getting kicked because your wifi accidently gets unpluged"", ""Very good games for almost all kind of device. Graphics and quality are really good. I love this game everyone should try this game. I am playing this game for 1 month. There is no issues. I was playing ff for 3.5 years.
